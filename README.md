# Djimitflo

**AI agent orchestration control plane for serious engineering teams**

Djimitflo is a production-grade UX/UI control plane for managing AI agent workflows with a verified OpenCode executor integration and a Codex-oriented roadmap. It provides enterprise-grade task management, approval workflows, security policies, and comprehensive audit trails.

> **Inspired by [ruflo](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo)** — the open-source agent orchestration framework for Claude Code, by [ruvnet](https://github.com/ruvnet). Djimitflo builds on the ideas pioneered in ruflo, extending them with a full dashboard, governance, and enterprise control plane. Check out [ruflo on GitHub](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo) and [Agentics on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/agentics-org/posts/?feedView=all) for the broader vision of agent-native tooling.

## Features

- **Mission Control Dashboard** — Real-time monitoring of agent tasks and system health
- **Task Management** — Create, track, and manage agent execution with approval gates
- **Agent Monitoring** — Track agent status, capabilities, and performance metrics
- **Security-First** — Default-deny policies, risk assessment, and approval workflows
- **Audit Trail** — Comprehensive logging of all agent actions and decisions with actor attribution
- **Authentication & Authorization** — JWT authentication, role-based access control (admin/operator/viewer), protected routes
- **WebSocket Updates** — Real-time task and execution event streaming
- **MCP Integration** — Manage Model Context Protocol servers and tools
- **Repository Intelligence** — Git-aware scanning, stack detection, health scoring, AGENTS.md governance (Phase 4.4)
- **Diff Awareness** — Pre/post execution git snapshots, secret redaction, risk-classified file changes (Phase 4.4)

## Architecture

Djimitflo is a TypeScript monorepo with three packages:

- **`@djimitflo/shared`** — Shared types and schemas (backend + frontend)
- **`@djimitflo/server`** — Express + SQLite backend with WebSocket support
- **`@djimitflo/dashboard`** — React + Vite + Tailwind frontend

## Integration Compatibility

| Integration | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **OpenCode** | Partially verified | CLI flags and JSON output verified against v1.15.4 |
| **Codex** | Not implemented | Type placeholder exists, no executor implementation |
| **Ruflo** | Conceptually mapped | No runtime dependency, conceptual inspiration only |

See [docs/integrations.md](docs/integrations.md) for full compatibility details.

## Known Limitations

- OpenCode session continuity (`--continue`, `--session`) not yet supported
- OpenCode MCP integration during execution not yet supported
- OpenCode agent selection passed through but not validated against known agents
- Codex executor requires CLI contract capture before implementation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

npm run build
```

### Development

Run the backend and frontend servers concurrently:

```bash
# Start both servers in parallel
npm run dev
```

Or run them individually:

```bash
# Start backend server (http://localhost:3001)
npm run dev:server

# Start frontend dashboard (http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev:dashboard
```

### Access

### Docker Deployment

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for full Docker deployment instructions.

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
# Edit .env.docker — set JWT_SECRET and bootstrap admin credentials
docker compose up -d
```

## Database Schema

Djimitflo uses SQLite with 20+ tables across 5 phases:

**Core**: `tasks`, `agents`, `execution_events`, `task_artifacts`, `mcp_servers`, `mcp_tools`, `repositories`, `audit_events`, `config`

**Phase 4.2 — Policy-aware execution**: `risk_assessments`, `policy_violations`, `approval_policies`, `approvals`

**Phase 4.3 — Evidence & observability**: `execution_evidence`, `execution_summaries`, `file_changes`

**Phase 4.4 — Repository intelligence**: `repository_scans`, `repository_health_findings`, `agents_md_files`, `agents_md_issues`, `task_repository_snapshots`

**Phase 5 — Auth & ownership**: `users`, `tasks.created_by/owner_user_id/updated_by`, `repositories.added_by`, `approvals.requested_by`

## Design System

Djimitflo uses a custom **djimit-\*** design token namespace with a dark-mode-first palette:

- Mission control aesthetic (enterprise monitoring)
- Semantic color system (status, risk, accent)
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI primitives

- [x] Multi-user ownership model (task, repository, approval ownership with visibility rules)
- [x] AuthorizationService with role-based and ownership-aware access control
- [x] Task ownership enforcement (created_by, owner_user_id, updated_by)

- [x] Evidence and review access scoped to underlying task ownership
- [x] Observability endpoints admin-only
- [x] Repository path/metadata redaction for non-admin users
- [x] MCP server secret redaction (env, command, args, url) for non-admin users
- [x] Legacy NULL-owned tasks visible to admin only
- [x] Backup & restore
- [ ] Export & reporting
